Renames all images and videos in a directory numberically with zero-padding for alignment with the largest number in the directory.

## Features

- Checks for any already existing numerical sorting system and adheres to it by converting their number-strings to integers and then sorts them before applyng the new numerics with zero-padding.
- Acounts for possible collisions and will always check for already existing files before renaming.
